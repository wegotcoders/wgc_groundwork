    about: "Hi, I’m Tamlyn.  I was born in Africa and lived my early years there until my family immigrated to Australia, where I studied, worked and lived in Melbourne. I’m now in the UK, staying with my brother in Shoreditch and scoping out coding schools! I’m a passionate traveller, interested in world issues, love to cook and hang out in nature. At university, I studied applied maths to Masters level. I then worked as a financial trader in the highly volatile energy markets.  My career was successful, which has provided me the opportunity to consider alternate paths going forward.  I remember telling someone I wanted to code over 20 years ago, and while I've done bits and pieces ad-hoc over the years, I'm now ready to dig into it properly.And thus, my motivation for reaching out to you!  I’m really excited about this next phase of my life and hungry to learn.",
    ambition: "In 1 year’s time, I’d like to be working with a small / medium size company, contributing and learning as a developer.  I realise that even with a LOT of hard work between now and then, I’ll still be on a very steep learning curve and actually this is incredibly appealing to me.  I have a passion for learning and never want to plateau in my life.  In 1 year’s time, I’d also like to be exploring areas of coding like machine-learning and other operations research algorithms.  Finally, having relocated from Australia to the UK (thanks to an EU passport), I’m keen to grow networks with like-minded people here, so in one year I'd love to know a bunch of developers and other digital types!",

    learning_experience:"For me, a positive learning and training environment is highly personal, interactive and very hands-on.  Small classes with a mix of teamwork and independent learning is great.  I don’t mind a bit of pressure and my nature is such that I tend eat, sleep and breathe any project I’m working on.  I definitely need to learn by doing.  I’m far more likely to learn something if I’m working on a real-world problem than if it’s theoretical.  This is what prompted me to steer my degree from pure maths to applied maths.Throughout my life, I’ve always sought teams to co-learn with and collaboration is a core value of mine. I love the thrill of hashing out a problem with small teams and I've noticed I tend to learn from friends and make friends with those who I'm learning with.  For self-learning, I prefer a quiet environment, though am able to get absorbed in a problem no matter where I am!",

    projects:"I lead a quant project for an energy trading desk which involved designing an entire risk system from scratch.  This was a 12 week project which involved various streams of work, including designing computational methodology, data sourcing (and back-up) and automation. I worked with a python programmer, though I coded most of the project in Matlab.  Our algorithms would daily source and pre-process a large amount of energy pricing data and then compute a range of risk metrics which were relied upon (and audited) by my employer, a global trading firm.",
    rationale:"Having researched many bootcamps, We Got Coders is uniquely appealing and I would love to join your May cohort -  you are by far my  number one choice.  I’m really impressed by the choices you’ve made in designing your bootcamp.  I believe a small, intense and dedicated class is far preferable and gives me comfort that you’re investing in us to be excellent (not just churn out a lot of “ok” coders).    It demonstrates the respect that you have for your coding students and this is evident in the testimonials I’ve read. I’m also impressed that We Got Coders is a digital agency (not just an education initiative) because that means you are sourcing what you’re teaching according to relevance in the real-world.  I’m very keen to be learning Ruby, not only because it appears to be increasingly used by many companies, but because I've found it intuitive to work with and seems to have a great community. I’m also very keen on the idea of a live-in bootcamp because not only do I hate commuting, but I also think it’d be great to get to know everyone outside of the classroom in a more informal setting like evening meals etc. The beautiful countryside setting would definitely help me focus for the long days of coding and it’s another example of the great choices I think you’ve made.",

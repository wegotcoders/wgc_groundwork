        <div class="profile-section box">  <h2>Objective</h2>
    <h5> My first coding experience was with Java. Now, I'm learning HTML, CSS and Javascript for the Front End Development and the Back End development later on.    </h5>
      <h5>My ambition ist at least to work as a permanent Junior Web Developer. Either as a Front End Developer or as a full stack developer.</h5>
           My expectation to this bootcamp is to do as many real projects as possible. Building useful websites like Doodle etc. Also pair programming can boost your motivation. The instructers could share their work experiences, so that the lesson sounds more lively than theoretically.
            The reason why I would like to become a Web developer: During the Odin Project I've noticed, that I like Web Development, so I would like to start a career in Web development.

<h1>About me</h1>
<p>I graduated from Goldsmiths University in 2011 where I studied BSc Computing & Information Systems and achieved a 2:1. While at university I became accustomed to learning new things in a short period of time as well as truly understanding the meaning and context of the material at hand.During those years it was stressful and I often felt the pressure, as I had a demanding part time job, university commitments - research, exams and coursework - and the need to carry out my personal duties when it came to my family and friends. I was successful in conquering the pressure and the stress by planning ahead and managing my time wisely. I believe this has made me a more resilient person as a whole who can adapt to demands of the situation.Growing up at a time where the industry is rapidly changing with the Internet enabling companies to reach new and wider audiences. The successful explosion of various companies coming to light has inspired me into thinking in a business orientated mind â€“ this in turn placed me on the pathway to learning a programming language. I set my sight into learning PHP due to it being an open source language and its worldwide popularity. I found it difficult at first but my determination and drive to succeed enabled me into learn the fundamentals of the language. I managed to secure an IT Support role to give me a better understanding of the industry as a whole. I dedicate my free time in mastering the language, learning and reading up on associated tools and technologies.Since March 2014 I have tried many languages such as Java, Ruby, PHP and JavaScript, as well as the scripting languages HTML and CSS. This is the reason why my journey has been tough but very fruitful. I began to understand object-orientated programming and how to code. I ended up learning more front-end development and visually witnessing the design, seeing a website take shape feels very pleasing and gives a sense of achievement and confidence. As I want to become a full stack developer, I have also learnt PHP with MySQL, for databases. I am highly motivated to learn in order to become a web developer, which is my ultimate goal.I created a website www.findabuddy.co.uk and an online profile called techbuddy. The website is a platform for me to add tutorials and blog about my journey into web development, to motivate myself and keep a diary of what I have learnt, which will also work as a revision tool.As I am self-taught within the field, I believe I have reached a point where I need to formalise what I have learnt and put it to practice as well as learn through guidance in the best practices in completing certain tasks. I would like to gain commercial experience as well as receive the support to further develop my skills and learn new things. I am confident and believe WeGotCoders will put me onto my desired path and help me to reach my goal.</p>

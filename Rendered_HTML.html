I loved physics at school but disappointed my poor Mum by following my passion to a Creative Music Technology degree (which if I had to summarise, was basically full-stack music: Writing, performing, music theory, studio engineering, record production). I still make music for fun and I feel sound mix engineering taught me a way of focussing on detail at the same time as seeing the big picture that’s been so valuable in my career. After university I got an admin job at a college which I turned into a data design/management job through self-teaching and youthful left-wing enthusiasm. This caught the eye of the MIS Director who made me the college data analyst. I kept learning and building systems, automating processes, gaining deeper SQL skills and more VBA, which led to becoming junior, then senior developer. I achieved integration across ~50 disparate systems and rapidly filled gaps with lean bespoke solutions. I was told by an experienced MIS consultant that my exam booking system was the best piece of in-house software he’d seen. I feel the key is enjoying one’s work enough to pull a lot of late-nighters and headphones full of baroque pop. I left my developer job in December and have since been teaching myself new skills, looking at discrete maths and making some money as a freelance sound recordist and mixer (fun but not challenging enough).It’s a cliche but the compliment I most frequently get for my coding is “creative”. Also, “business context aware” and “insightful”. As a person I'm told I’m friendly, chatty, honest and enthused.</textarea>

I’m currently using codewars and other resources to learn javascript, ruby and swift but I know how much faster it could be.

My current skillset is leading me towards being a DBA, and however much money there is in that, I want to stay creative and become more useful. I want to learn proper object oriented programming and start making things from the ground-up.

A bootcamp is the perfect thing and this is clearly the best one going.</textarea>

                            <textarea name="trainee[projects]" class="profile-value-input">At Hackney Community College most students have to do numeracy and literacy exams. These are scheduled on a very flexible basis at short notice according to individual students’ progress. I built a system a with SQL Server and MS Access few years ago for teachers to manage the scheduling, registration and results for these with an aim at optimal room utilisation.
This was good but I later found that many teachers and admin were combatting a high no-show rate by spending a lot of time using our SMS app to remind their students. This was reportedly effective but very laborious.

So I proposed and over a few joyful days built a general infrastructure in SQL server for an SMS auto-mailer. This included a small interface allowing MIS staff to create a message wording template to mail-merge with any SQL dataset query so long as it had a mobile number field. Surprisingly, I couldn’t find this product on the market for less than £20k.

The first of these templates was used to send thousands of students SMS exam details, greeting them by name, plus reminders 1 week and 1 day before their exam. It was very popular with staff and students and replies were automatically routed to the email of the appropriate teacher plus a digest of which texts had failed or were delayed.

Still, I wasn’t satisfied that this was definitely a good idea (even if it was mine) so I proposed and ran a randomised controlled trial. This actually showed that the texts appeared to make little difference to the no-show rate for the researched sub-group. We surmised that those teachers who felt they had success manually sending in the past were probably also the teachers who engaged best generally. That enabled us to better understand what caused students to miss exams.

In any case, the created infrastructure had a side-effect. It was now easy to send course applicants interview reminders straight from our main CRM and this proved very effective, helping to drive better course occupancy. We found there were more and more helpful ways we could use the system and it became core to many college processes.

This system was programmed nearly entirely with SQL objects: scalar and table-valued functions, views and stored procedures. The central objects made REST calls to our SMS gateway, including polling for delivery status on an optimised inverse-exponential schedule. </textarea>

After the basics, it means thinking big, encouraging tangential links between ideas and disciplines, allowing students to work together and bounce off each other.  I'm always amazed to see how many good ways different people can solve a problem.</textarea>
